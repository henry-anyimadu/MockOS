# Studio 20
Kelenna Eke-Okoro, Henry Anyimadu, Jonah Sachs
Part 2e: To prevent memory leaks, as the proxy takes ownership of the dynamically allocated file object.

Part 4: Created TextFile, wrapped in PasswordProxy ("secret"). Tested write: failed with wrong password, succeeded with correct password. Tested read: failed (empty vector/error) with wrong password, succeeded with correct password. Observed password prompts.

Part 5: Document any unit tests for Studio 20 that failed initially and explain how you resolved them. If all passed, state that.
